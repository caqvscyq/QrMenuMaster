# Session Management Fix Report

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Configuration Files**
**Problem**: The unified-server was missing critical configuration files that were referenced in the code but didn't exist in the source directory.

**Root Cause**: The TypeScript source files for database, logger, and Redis configuration were missing from `src/config/` directory, even though compiled JavaScript versions existed in `dist/config/`.

**Solution**: Created the missing TypeScript configuration files:
- `src/config/database.ts` - Database connection and testing
- `src/config/logger.ts` - Winston logging configuration  
- `src/config/redis.ts` - Redis caching configuration

### 2. **Port Configuration Mismatch**
**Problem**: Frontend applications were configured to proxy API requests to port 5000, but the server was sometimes running on different ports due to port conflicts.

**Root Cause**: The server was encountering port conflicts and falling back to alternative ports, while frontend proxies remained hardcoded to port 5000.

**Solution**: Ensured the server runs consistently on port 5000 to match frontend proxy configurations.

## ✅ Verification Results

### Session Creation Test
```
✅ Session created successfully: session-A1-1750196462927-eb8mwg681
   Table: A1
   Status: active
```

### Session Authentication Test
```
✅ Customer auth - Session ID: "session-A1-1750196462927-eb8mwg681", Table: "A1"
✅ Extracted table number from session: "A1"
✅ Session validation successful for table: "A1"
```

### Cart Operations Test
```
✅ Cart operation successful
✅ Cart retrieval successful
   Cart items: 1
```

### Session Format Validation
```
✅ Session format is correct
   Format: session-{table}-{timestamp}-{random}
   Pattern: /^session-[A-Za-z0-9_-]+-\d{13}-[A-Za-z0-9]{6,15}$/
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Session ID Format
The system correctly generates session IDs in the format:
```
session-{tableNumber}-{timestamp}-{randomString}
```

Example: `session-A1-1750196462927-eb8mwg681`

### Table ID Extraction
The system correctly extracts table numbers from session IDs:
```javascript
const tableNumber = sessionId.split('-')[1]; // Returns "A1"
```

### Database Integration
- ✅ Database connection working
- ✅ Session storage in PostgreSQL
- ✅ Redis caching operational
- ✅ Session expiration handling
