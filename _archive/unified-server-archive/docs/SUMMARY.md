# QR Menu Master - Architecture Summary

## Project Overview

We've successfully refactored a QR code restaurant ordering system by merging two separate servers (Customer Server and Admin Server) into a unified server architecture. This unified approach maintains all existing functionalities while improving performance, security, and maintainability.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Unified Backend

- **Single Express Application**: Combined both backends into a single Node.js/Express application.
- **Separated API Routes**: Maintained clear separation between customer and admin APIs:
  - Customer APIs: `/api/customer/*`
  - Admin APIs: `/api/admin/*`
- **Shared Database Service**: Created a unified database service that handles operations for both customer and admin functionalities.

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented JWT-based authentication for admins and session-based authentication for customers.
- **Middleware Approach**: Created separate middleware for customer and admin authentication.
- **Security Measures**: Implemented token verification, password hashing, and proper error handling.

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- **Redis Caching**: Added Redis caching for frequently accessed data like menu items and categories.
- **Efficient Database Queries**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing and joins.
- **Static Asset Serving**: Configured Nginx for efficient static asset serving with proper caching headers.

### 4. Real-Time Updates

- **WebSocket Integration**: Implemented Socket.IO for real-time order updates.
- **Event-Based Communication**: Created a publish/subscribe pattern for order status changes.
- **Room-Based Connections**: Organized WebSocket connections into rooms for efficient message delivery.

### 5. Deployment Strategy

- **Docker Containerization**: Created Docker and Docker Compose configurations for easy deployment.
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Added Nginx as a reverse proxy with SSL termination and security headers.
- **Environment Configuration**: Implemented environment variables for flexible configuration.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Structure

- **API Layer**: Separated customer and admin routes for clear organization.
- **Service Layer**: Created database and WebSocket services for business logic.
- **Middleware Layer**: Implemented authentication, caching, and error handling middleware.
- **Configuration Layer**: Centralized configuration for database, Redis, and logging.

### Database Design

- Maintained the existing PostgreSQL schema with tables for:
  - `users`: Admin and staff user accounts
  - `shops`: Restaurant information
  - `categories`: Menu categories
  - `menuItems`: Individual menu items
  - `cartItems`: Customer shopping cart
  - `orders`: Customer orders
  - `orderItems`: Individual items within orders
  - `desks`: Restaurant tables/desks

### Security Measures

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for admins.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Simple but effective authentication for customers.
- **HTTPS Support**: SSL/TLS configuration in Nginx.
- **Security Headers**: Added security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
- **Input Validation**: Used Zod schema validation for all inputs.

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Simplified Deployment**: Single application to deploy and maintain.
2. **Reduced Resource Usage**: Shared resources between customer and admin functionality.
3. **Consistent Data Access**: Single source of truth for all data operations.
4. **Improved Performance**: Added caching and optimized database queries.
5. **Better Security**: Consistent authentication and authorization approach.
6. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for instant notifications.
7. **Scalability**: Docker-based deployment for easy scaling.

## Future Improvements

1. **Microservices Option**: The modular design allows for future splitting into microservices if needed.
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: The architecture supports load balancing across multiple instances.
3. **Analytics Integration**: The unified data model makes it easier to add analytics capabilities.
4. **Mobile App Support**: The API design is compatible with future mobile app development.
5. **Payment Gateway Integration**: The order processing flow can be extended with payment processing.

## Conclusion

The refactored architecture successfully meets all the requirements while providing a more maintainable and scalable solution. The unified server approach simplifies deployment and operations while maintaining clear separation of concerns in the codebase.
