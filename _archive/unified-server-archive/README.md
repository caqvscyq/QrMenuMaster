## Purpose

These files were moved to the archive to:

1. **Clean up the main project directory** - Remove clutter from development files
2. **Preserve development history** - Keep important debugging and testing tools
3. **Maintain reference materials** - Keep documentation and reports accessible
4. **Enable future debugging** - Preserve tools that might be useful later

## Usage

If you need to reference any of these files:

1. **For testing**: Check the `tests/` directory for relevant test scripts
2. **For debugging**: Use tools in the `debug/` directory
3. **For documentation**: Refer to files in the `docs/` directory
4. **For configuration**: Check `backup-configs/` for alternative setups

## Important Notes

- These files are **not part of the active codebase**
- They are **safe to delete** if disk space is needed
- They are **kept for reference only**
- Some may contain **outdated code** that doesn't reflect current implementation

## Restoration

If you need to restore any file to the main project:

```bash
# Example: Restore a test file
cp archive/tests/test-session-fix.js ./

# Example: Restore documentation
cp archive/docs/SESSION_MANAGEMENT_FIX_REPORT.md ./
```
